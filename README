  Contributing to pylockfile
==============================

The pylockfile library has been adopted by the OpenStack Oslo program,
and development is now managed using our regular tool chain.

If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack,
you must follow the steps in the "If you're a developer, start here"
section of this page:

   http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at:

   http://wiki.openstack.org/GerritWorkflow

If you would like to fork or clone the repository from GitHub, please
use https://github.com/openstack/pylockfile instead of this
repository.  However, pull requests submitted through GitHub will be
ignored.

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not GitHub:

   https://bugs.launchpad.net/pylockfile
